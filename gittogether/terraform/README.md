# Terraform: AWS VPC + EKS for GitTogether

Provisions, in `ap-south-1` (Mumbai):

| Resource | Details |
|---|---|
| VPC | `10.20.0.0/16` across two AZs: 2 public subnets (load balancer, NAT), 2 private subnets (worker nodes), internet gateway, 1 NAT gateway |
| EKS cluster | Kubernetes 1.36, pinned to **standard** support |
| Managed node group | 3 × `t3.medium` on-demand (min 2, max 4) in private subnets, Amazon Linux 2023 |
| EKS add-ons | vpc-cni, kube-proxy, coredns, pod-identity-agent, aws-ebs-csi-driver, metrics-server |

Modules: `terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws` 6.7.3 and `terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws` 21.25.3.

## Cost decisions

EKS is never free. While the cluster exists it costs roughly **$0.35/hour** (control plane $0.10, three nodes ~$0.13, NAT gateway ~$0.06, load balancer and public IPs ~$0.05). Nothing is billed between `terraform destroy` and the next `apply`. Choices:

- **Worker nodes in private subnets** behind a NAT gateway, the production pattern: nodes have no public IPs.
- **A single NAT gateway** shared by both AZs instead of one per AZ (halves the NAT cost; acceptable for a non-production cluster).
- **3 nodes, not 2.** A `t3.medium` runs at most 17 pods; the app, Prometheus/Grafana and ArgoCD need more than 34.
- **No customer-managed KMS key or CloudWatch control-plane logs.** Both bill monthly and would outlive a short demo.
- **Kubernetes version in standard support.** Versions in extended support cost $0.60/hr for the control plane instead of $0.10/hr.
- **On-demand nodes, not spot.** Spot is cheaper but can be reclaimed in the middle of a demo.

## Usage

```bash
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars   # optional; the defaults match it
terraform init
terraform fmt -check && terraform validate
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply tfplan                          # ~15-20 minutes

aws eks update-kubeconfig --region ap-south-1 --name gittogether-eks
kubectl get nodes
```

AWS credentials come from `aws configure`. They are never stored in this folder.

## Destroying (same day, every time)

Kubernetes creates some AWS resources itself (the Ingress load balancer and the PostgreSQL EBS volume). Terraform doesn't know about them, so remove them first or `terraform destroy` will hang on the VPC and leave paid volumes behind:

```bash
helm uninstall gittogether -n gittogether        # app + its PersistentVolumeClaim
kubectl delete pvc --all -n gittogether
helm uninstall ingress-nginx -n ingress-nginx    # deletes the AWS load balancer
kubectl get svc -A | grep LoadBalancer           # must print nothing
terraform destroy
```

Afterwards, check the AWS console (EC2 → Load Balancers, Volumes; VPC → Your VPCs) for anything tagged `Project = gittogether`.
